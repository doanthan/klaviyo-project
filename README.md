Use cases:

Use case 1: Brands may have messy address data from years of data collection. It is also hard to impress customers and show personalisation that gives a great customer experience.


Use case 2: Brands maye have multiple local employees who need to add profiles to their local list, but don't need to be granted access to the Klaviyo platform.


Use case 3: Ecommerce stores may have a customer support department who may find it useful to track customers actions to help resolve customer issues. This helps brands provide better customer support and better customer experience.
